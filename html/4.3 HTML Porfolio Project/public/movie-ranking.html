    <h3>1. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle 1: 9.9/10</h3>
    <p>
      By far my favorite movie of the year. I'm a huge demon slayer fan and this
      movie did not disappoint. Seeing the manga come to life was unreal,
      Ufotable did an amazing job with choreographing the fights and turning
      somewhat bland manga fight scenes into intense and emotional big screen
      battles. The movie made me cry and the soundtrack was captivating. My only
      critique is that they didn't announce Zenitsu's win, after he solo'd Upper
      Moon 6
    </p>

    <h3>2. Superman: 8.7/10</h3>
    <p>
      I honestly think this might've been one of the best DC live action movies
      of all time. James Gunn is a unique director and you can see it in his
      production quality. Not much to say, it's definitely a breath of fresh air
      from everything we've received from DCCU so far. I will be watching the
      rest of what James Gunn has prepared for DC
    </p>

    <h3>3. Fantastic Four: First Steps: 8.3/10</h3>
    <p>
      It was aight. Not the biggest fan of the casting. Looking forward to
      Spider-Man tho!
