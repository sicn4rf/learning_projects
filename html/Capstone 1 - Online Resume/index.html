    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      I'm a UC Irvine transfer from Fullerton College who is passionate about
      building useful software and helping others level up. Tutoring C++ taught
      me to explain clearly, debug patiently, and write code that's easy to read
      and hard to break. From shipping full-stack features to conducting
      research projects, I bring steady output, thoughtful communication, and a
      bias for clean, tested solutions.

    <h3>Embedded Computer Science Tutor -- Fullerton College</h3>
    <p>October 2024 - Present</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Grew session attendance by 60% QoQ and boosted returning-student rate by
        50% by running targeted outreach (in-class invites, Discord posts),
        simplifying sign-ups, and designing themed review blocks that made
        sessions easier and more enjoyable to attend.
      </li>

      <li>
        Supported 30+ students/term in C++ (debugging, design, core concepts),
        raising code correctness and readability by teaching step-through
        reasoning, test scaffolds, and a consistent style guide.
      </li>

      <li>
        Increased practice quality and engagement by authoring targeted
        exercises and leading interactive reviews, helping students internalize
        arrays, pointers, and basic data structures through short, iterative
        challenges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accelerated student iteration and confidence by providing individualized
        feedback focused on error-pattern spotting, decomposition, and
        naming/style discipline, leading to fewer regrade cycles and cleaner
        submissions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software Engineering Intern -- Ena Pragma</h3>
    <p>Jul 2025 - Sep 2025</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Shipped production-grade full-stack JS apps and SEO-optimized sites for
        B2B clients, resulting in faster page loads and clearer conversion paths
        by profiling bottlenecks, compressing assets, and tightening API usage.
      </li>

      <li>
        Accelerated prototyping cycles from idea â†’ demo in days by leveraging AI
        dev tools (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, v0.dev) and setting
        repeatable scaffolds for UI, auth, and routing.
      </li>

      <li>
        Improved usability and perceived performance by implementing REST
        integrations, refining information architecture, and optimizing
        client-side rendering (fewer blocking calls, better caching).
      </li>

      <li>
        Tightened delivery loop with stakeholders by running requirement
        walkthroughs, demoing milestones, and translating feedback into tickets,
        which reduced back-and-forth and clarified acceptance criteria.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Research Intern -- California State Univesrity, Fullerton</h3>
    <p>May 2025 - Jun 2025</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Built a C++/Python pipeline screening 9,900+ equity pairs across 5
        sectors, enabling correlation, cointegration, and mean-reversion
        analysis by aligning 12 months of daily prices for 225 equities and
        computing Pearson matrices and OLS residuals.
      </li>

      <li>
        Narrowed candidates to statistically significant pairs by running
        Engle-Granger tests in Python (statsmodels), which focused backtesting
        on the most promising spreads.
      </li>

      <li>
        Validated strategy behavior with a mean-reversion simulator, surfacing
        top-performing pairs per sector by codifying entry/exit, stop, and
        reversion thresholds.
      </li>

      <li>
        Delivered an end-to-end research poster and a working GitHub repo,
        demonstrating reproducible results via clean data wrangling,
        cross-language integration, and parameterized runs.
      </li>
    </ul>
